| SR-13 | System shall support page-based routing | 4.5.2 (Page-Based Routing) | Covered |
| SR-14 | System shall track frontend and/or action | 3.3.7, 3.3.8 (Allocation History & Dashboard) | Covered |

### Non-Functional Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | SRS Section | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Stateless backend - no server-side session for MVP | 4.2.1 (Authentication), 4.5.1 (Frontend-Backend Separation) | Covered |
| Atomic DB updates for availability and allocations | 4.3.4 (Database Atomicity) | Covered |
| Clear error codes (400/401/404/409) | 4.3.3 (Error Handling) | Covered |

### Data Persistence Requirements

The system shall persist the following entities:

| Entity | SRS Section | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Users | 7.2 (Data Persistence: User Accounts) | Covered |
| Projects | 7.2 (Data Persistence: Projects) | Covered |
| Hardware Sets (HWSet1, HWSet2) | 7.2 (Data Persistence: Hardware Sets) | Covered |
| Resource Requests | 7.2 (Data Persistence: Resource Requests) | Covered |
| Allocations (checkout/check-in) | 7.2 (Data Persistence: Resource Allocations) | Covered |

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Stateless Backend**: Backend MUST NOT maintain server-side sessions
   - State management moved entirely to client-side React Context
   - All authentication state stored in frontend
   - Backend validates each request independently

2. **Atomic Database Operations**: 
   - Uses MongoDB for direct atomic updates
   - Ensures availability calculations remain consistent

3. **Error Code Standards**:
   - `200 OK` - Successful request
   - `400 Bad Request` - Invalid input or validation failure
   - `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication required or failed
   - `404 Not Found` - Resource doesn't exist
   - `409 Conflict` - Resource conflict (duplicate, insufficient capacity, etc.)

4. **Hardware Management**:
   - Two hardware sets: HWSet1 and HWSet2
   - Real-time availability calculated as: `available = totalCapacity - allocatedUnits`
   - Hardware checkout and check-in endpoints are implemented
   - Approval workflow is designed but not yet implemented

5. **Project Context**:
   - Projects serve as organizational units for hardware requests
   - Users can create and join projects
   - Resources are allocated to projects, not individual users

### API Endpoints Summary

All endpoints are documented in **Section 5.3.1** of the SRS:

**User Management:**
- `GET /api/users` - List users
- `POST /api/users` - Create user

**Project Management:**
- `GET /api/projects` - List projects
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project

**Hardware Management:**
- `GET /api/hardware` - Get hardware definitions
- `GET /api/hardware/availability` - Get real-time availability
- `POST /api/hardware/{id}/checkout` - Checkout hardware
- `POST /api/hardware/{id}/checkin` - Check-in hardware
- `GET /api/allocations` - View allocation history

---

**Status**: All requirements have been incorporated into the SRS document.
